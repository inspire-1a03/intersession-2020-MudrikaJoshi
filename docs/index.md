Electronics for the rest of us!

## Day 1: Reflection


The first day of this module was quite informative for me. We went over an introduction to the module and due to the kits not arriving on time we skipped ahead and went over how to use Github. This was my first time using the program and I had some issues with creating a repository. My problems were resolved with assistance and I think that going forward practicing  the functions of the website will help me with this issue.  I come from a Commerce background  and am currently finishing up my third year in the program. This course initially sparked my attention when I saw a post on avenue about a new course being offered in the spring term. As I am finishing up my degree I wanted to take more courses that are not related to my specialization to widen my horizons. The electronics module came into my interest as I have never taken a course related to electronics/coding or even done it for leisure. This seemed like an excellent opportunity to learn something new. My expectations from this course are to establish an introduction to GitHub and learn to learn basic info about how circuit boards work. The only background I have is from high school science, where I vaguely remember series and parallel circuits. I hope to use this week gain my understanding of circuits and even create a device that can be used to perform an everyday activity.

## Day 2: Results

[Here is a link to my Arduino sketch for day 2](https://github.com/inspire-1a03/intersession-2020-MudrikaJoshi/blob/master/RGB_LED.ino)

The device that I made today works as a weather station. It reads the temperature of the room from a thermistor and an led lights up when the temperatures reach a certain number. The range is from 15 to 20 degrees. The most challenging part of making this device was getting the wiring to be correct and making the code set to the right temperatures. The wiring was the first challenge I dealt with, the light on the LED was not turning on at first; I had to change the wiring on the breadboard as my divide had a common cathode. The second challenge was the code on Arduino, the temperature is not very high in my room and it is hard to get it to 30 degrees, so I changed the code to a lower temperature to make my decide easily compatible with the room.

The device created is a weather station, it can be used to monitor the temperature in a room or even at a larger scale such as a measure the temperature outside. The device works by using a thermistor and reading the temperature in the room. The thermistor is connected to an LED bulb that changes colours. This device has been programmed to turn red when the temperature is over 20 degrees, go green and play a specific tone when it is between 18-19 degrees or any other temperature that is not stated and turns blue and plays a different tone when the temperature reads 15-18 degrees. All the components are connected to a breadboard, circuit, and computer that monitors the readings and makes necessary changes. This device can be useful in monitoring the temperature for extremely temperature-sensitive things such as certain breeds of animals and even ice sculptures. Some animals that are kept in captivity away from their natal environment may need to be kept in temperature-controlled areas, this device can help monitor and notify you if and when there is a change. The weather station can also be used at a larger scale to monitor the temperature of a city and record any changes during the day. 


| Feature | Description | Other Notes |
|---------|:-------------:|-------------:|
|LED |Light that changes colours according to program |Red over 20 degrees, Green/Pink at 18-19 Degrees,Blue at 15-18 Degrees |
|Thermometer |Measures the tempreature in the room |Avg range is 15- 25 Degrees Celsuis |
|Buzzer |Plays a specific tone when the room tempreature reaches a certain level|Over 20 no tone, 18-19 tone 12, 15-18 tone 31 |

## Final reflection & summary

My experience in this module has been unique and rewarding. It was my first time using a circuit board and software to make a device that would serve a useful purpose. The experience was also very rewarding. After multiple attempts to make the code work or trial and error in the wiring; I felt a sense of reward to see the finished product that would do what it was programmed to. The initial days of the module were tougher than the latter since the material was so new to me. I found the more I practiced the fewer complications I came across. I learned how to problem-solve while working on a hands-on task that has a direct result, as opposed to the theoretical problem solving I am used to doing. I liked that even though the module was delivered online, there was no significant comprise of learning. This was an opportunity to develop technical skills and practice “working from home”, as it will be emphasized in the coming weeks and months. I had some difficulties in understanding the software initially, but those were solved through the meetings on zoom. One major difficulty for me was the hardware. When creating a device I kept on coming to a road bump when installing the buzzer. The sketch was running, but there was no noise. Luckily, I had been sent two kits in the mail and the other one arrived on the last day of the module and it had a functioning buzzer. I have defiantly learned skills very different from my major and can even use some of them in the future. For example, GitHub can be used to make a webpage and now that I know the basics it will be simple for me to do. I have also learned basic wiring skills that I may be able to use when installing the next light fixture in my home (eg. Connect the wire to ground and 5v for power). All in all, it was a great experience and I am very fortunate to have had the opportunity to take this module!
